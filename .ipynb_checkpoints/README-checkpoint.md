# Machine-learning-project
- *Harmonic_Oscillator_NN.ipynb*, *harmonic_oscillator_PINN_final.ipynb* and *harmonic_oscillator_PINN_final_full_opt.ipynb* train the models NN, PINN (fixed) and PINN (full), respectively.

- *Compare_NN_PINN.ipynb* compares models with each other.

- Folder *Models* contains trained models used for comparison.
